## Getting started

### Prerequisites

#### Sitecore Experience Platform

The latest Habitat Home Corporate site is built to support the following version of the Sitecore Experience Platform: ***Sitecore Experience Platform 9.2 Initial release***

In order to install the latest version of Sitecore that works with the Habitat Home Corporate site, **[you need to head over to the Sitecore.HabitatHome.Utilities repository](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore.HabitatHome.Utilities)** and follow the instructions there. The Sitecore.HabitatHome.Utilities repository is a collection of useful utilities and script examples to help in the context of the Habitat Home demos, of which one is this Habitat Home Corporate site.

**Note:** You should skip the `.\install-modules` step in the Utilities repository. Habitat Home Corporate does not require the Sitecore Powershell Extensions or Sitecore Experience Accelerator modules.

#### URL Rewrite module

As part of the Habitat Home Corporate installation, an IIS URL rewrite rule is added to the web.config file in order to enforce HTTPS requests on the website. Please ensure you have the [URL Rewrite module](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite) installed or you will receive a 500.19 error after deployment.

### Deployment

1. Open an elevated (run as admin) PowerShell terminal at the root of your working copy.
2. Deployment of the Habitat Home Corporate demo can be done using either:
    - Unicorn

      Run `.\build.ps1`

    - Team Development for Sitecore Classic (TDS)

      Run `.\build.ps1 -Target "Build-TDS"`
